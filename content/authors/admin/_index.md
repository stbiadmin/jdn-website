Hey! I'm Justin Norman.

I'm a second year PhD student at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by [Hany Farid](https://farid.berkeley.edu/). I am interested in research in computer vision, computational photography, machine learning and machine learning engineering. I am the recipient of the [Marcus Foster Fellowship](https://www.marcusfoster.org/marcus-foster-fellowship).

My last role in industry was VP, Data Science, Analytics and Data Products at Yelp. I was responsible for five functional Data Science teams as well as and the corporate Data Product Management team (Data and Analytics, Experimentation, Trust and Safety and Applied Machine Learning). I also led development of the DS/ML experimentation platform (Bunsen) and the Core Machine Learning Platform. Outside of the organic responsibilities of the role I also provide strategic leadership in Machine Learning, Data Science and Analytics to the Chief Product Officer, CEO and Executive Leadership Team.

Previously, I was the Director of Research and Data Science at Cloudera Fast Forward Labs, Head of Applied Machine Learning at Fitbit, the Global Head of Cisco’s Enterprise Data Science Office and a Big Data Systems Engineer with Booz Allen Hamilton.  In another life, I served as a Marine Corps Officer, with a focus in Systems Analytics and Intelligence. I am a graduate of the US Naval Academy with a degree in Computer Science and the University of Southern California with a Master’s Degree in Business Administration and Business Analytics.
