abstract: 

  In 2003, Wilbert McKreith, was charged with a string of bank robberies
  across South Florida. During his trial, jurors were presented with circumstantial
  evidence against McKreith. During

  An FBI examiner then testified that the button-down plaid shirt
  found in McKreith’s home was the exact shirt worn by the masked robber
  depicted in surveillance video. The examiner did so by matching the
  misalignment in the plaid pattern along the shirt seams, Figure 1. When
  asked by the prosecutor as to the odds that two different shirts would
  exhibit this same match, the FBI examiner responded “1 in 650 billion,
  give or take a few billion.”

  The jury convicted McKrieth, who is serving a 92-year prison sentence.
  The only evidence that directly linked him to the crime was the
  FBI examiner’s plaid shirt analysis.

  We propose to improve the state of photographic forensic identification. These efforts will
  include - 

  1. Determining the reliability of 2-D photographic identification techniques based on the wear
  on the seams of denim jeans, regularly-patterned clothing (e.g., plaid, polka dots), and
  irregularly-patterned clothing (e.g., camouflage).

  2. Developing new 2-D photographic identification techniques that, as much as possible, removes human subjectivity from the process.

  3. Employing 3-D human-body modeling to improve the accuracy of clothing-based forensic
  identification, as well as general identification based on a person’s height and weight.

  4. Comparing each forensic identification techniques against human analysts.

  Throughout, we will determine the distinctiveness and reliability of patterns used to identify an
  individual, Table 1. These criteria will be used to determine the true positive rate (the probability
  that a correct match will be made) and the false positive rate (the probability that an incorrect
  match will be made). These error-rates, in particular, have been lacking in previous work, and are
  particularly important so that juries and judges can assess the reliability of a forensic identification.
