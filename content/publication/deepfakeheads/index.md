abstract:   The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.
