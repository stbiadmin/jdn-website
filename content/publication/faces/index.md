abstract: I propose a project that improves upon the principles demonstrated in both H.Farid et al. Forensic Reconstruction of Severely Degraded License Plates and Menon, Damian, Ruden et al PULSE Self-Supervised Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration of Generative Models in order to asesss the reliability of forensic tools which seek to confirm the identify of a person from two separate images one downsampled, distorted and noisy and the other a high-resolution sample.
